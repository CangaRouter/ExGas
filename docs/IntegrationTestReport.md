# Integration approach

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence
    (ex: class A, class A+B, class A+B+C, etc)>



#  Tests

   <define below a table for each integration step. For each integration step report the group of classes under test, and the names of
     JUnit test cases applied to them>
