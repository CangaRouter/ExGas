# Dependency graph 

     <report the here the dependency graph of the classes in it/polito/Ezgas, using plantuml>
     
# Integration approach

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence
    (ex: step1: class A, step 2: class A+B, step 3: class A+B+C, etc)>



#  Tests

   <define below a table for each integration step. For each integration step report the group of classes under test, and the names of
     JUnit test cases applied to them>

## Step 1
| Classes  | JUnit test cases |
|--|--|
|||


## Step 2
| Classes  | JUnit test cases |
|--|--|
|||


## API Tests

   <The last integration step  should correspond to API testing, or tests applied to all classes implementing the APIs defined in the Service package>

| Classes  | JUnit test cases |
