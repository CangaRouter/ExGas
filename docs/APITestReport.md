# Coverage of Scenarios


<Report in the following table the coverage of the scenarios listed above. Report at least an API test (defined on the functions of DataImpl only) and a GUI test (created with EyeAutomate) for each of the scenarios. For each scenario, report the functional requirements it covers.
In the API Tests column, report the name of the method of the API Test JUnit class you created. In the GUI Test column, report the name of the .txt file with the test case you created.>
